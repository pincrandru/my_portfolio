                        <p class="p">The company Marshrutka has launched a service in Russia where taxi drivers
                            can integrate
                            into urban public transport routes, thereby meeting the travel needs of city residents.

                            not
                            with a travel pass. The price depends on how many "stops" you travel. Drivers can join a
                            route
                            from
                            any stop but must complete a full route loop. Any number of such "loops" is permissible.</p>

                <h2 class="h2">Context</h2>
                <p class="p">The current urban transport system does not always effectively cover all passenger
                    routes,
                    leaving gaps in accessibility and service quality, especially for those seeking more flexible and
                    comfortable solutions than traditional public transport, yet more affordable than a standard taxi.
                    Additionally, taxi drivers often face idle time and inefficient use of their time and resources. The
                    Marshrutka service aims to address these problems by offering an innovative hybrid of traditional
                    taxis and urban public transport. This not only allows city residents to comfortably and quickly
                    reach their destinations, effectively bridging gaps in the transport network, but also provides taxi
                    drivers with stable and predictable income through fixed routes, along with efficient use of their
                    time and fuel. Such a solution improves urban mobility, relieves pressure on existing transport
                    modes, positively impacts the city's economy by increasing economic activity, and ultimately creates
                    a significant business opportunity for Marshrutka, enabling it to scale, optimize operations, and
                    increase revenue through a unique cross-market offering.</p>
