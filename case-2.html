                <p class="p">Develop a solution to enhance the convenience and efficiency of ATM usage.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="goal">
                <h2 class="h2">Defining the goal</h2>
                <p class="p">ATMs are an integral part of people's financial lives. Although this technology has existed
                    for a
                    long time and is firmly integrated into our lives, the user experience has not fundamentally
                    changed. Improving the ATM user experience will allow clients to reliably, securely, simply, and
                    comfortably perform monetary operations. This will increase trust in the bank and its services,
                    attract new clients, reduce the burden on bank representatives and support staff, expand bank
                    services to underserved audiences, and all of this, accordingly, can lead to increased company
                    revenue.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="audience">
                <h2 class="h2">Defining the audience</h2>
                <p class="p">The two main and large groups to which the bank extends its services are legal entities and
                    individuals. In this task, we will focus on individuals.</p>
                <p class="p">ATMs are used by people of various ages, incomes, social classes, and social groups.
                    However, users
                    can be stratified by their experience and specific characteristics that may influence their user
                    experience.</p>
                <span class="group-name">Youth and middle-aged adults</span>
                <p class="p p-space">This group of clients is typically tech-savvy, frequently
                    uses ATMs, and
                    has no difficulty operating them. This is also the largest cohort of bank clients, as they
                    constitute the main part of the economically active population and, accordingly, interact more
                    frequently and extensively with financial services.</p>
                <span class="group-name">Teenagers</span>
                <p class="p p-space">Although they are minors and not part of the general workforce cohort, they
                    are
                    increasingly expanding their economic rights and can be bank clients. Parents can issue them debit
                    cards, either as an additional card to their own account or to the teenager's individual account.
                    Modern teenagers have no trouble understanding the technical aspects of an ATM or a mobile
                    application, but they are not as financially literate as adults and require more parental oversight.
                </p>
                <span class="group-name">Elderly people</span>
                <p class="p p-space">Digital products often pose challenges for them, although elderly people
                    are still
                    economically active and require the same access to bank services and products. Improving the ATM
                    user experience can make it appealing to them and also increase loyalty to the bank.</p>
                <span class="group-name">Foreigners</span>
                <p class="p p-space">They also need to use ATMs and expect their experience to be considered,
                    enabling them to
                    meet their needs in a language they understand.</p>
                <span class="group-name">People with special health needs</span>
                <p class="p p-space">Many health conditions make ATM usage difficult, and
                    improvements
                    in interaction can help clients who need additional features or require the absence of physical
                    limitations.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="h2">Understanding the context and audience needs</h2>
                <p class="p">ATMs are placed in locations that allow quick access at the client's convenience, usually
                    near places
                    where people conduct financial transactions. Therefore, these are typically crowded areas, such as
                    city centers, high-concentration areas in districts (shops and shopping centers), and bank branches.
                </p>
                <p class="p">If the ATM is located outdoors, it must be used in various weather conditions ‚Äî it may be
                    snowing,
                    raining, or the sun may be shining and glinting off the screen. Also, queues often form around ATMs,
                    which can make people nervous and put pressure on the person currently using the machine.</p>
                <p class="p">Clients expect ATMs to be available 24/7, especially if they are outdoors, and in some
                    cases, inside
                    buildings and bank branches after closing hours. Users also count on round-the-clock support if
                    something goes wrong.</p>
                <p class="p">Furthermore, users expect the ATM to be maintained ‚Äî it should be clean, buttons should
                    work, cash
                    should be consistently supplied in various denominations, foreign currency should be available, all
                    functions should be accessible, and the machine should generally be operational.</p>
                <p class="p">Contactless payment has become widespread and common, so ATMs should support it. Along with
                    this,
                    popular payment systems should be supported, as well as a limited range of actions that can be
                    performed without needing to remember a PIN code.</p>
                <p class="p">An important aspect remains security and ensuring the confidentiality of the actions a
                    client
                    performs at the ATM.</p>
                <p class="p">Attention should also be paid to the emotional aspect of using an ATM. The entire user
                    experience
                    should be clear, simple, comfortable, stress-free, prevent errors, or report them correctly.</p>
                <p class="p">Separately, accessibility elements should be considered ‚Äì Braille, audio assistant, absence
                    of
                    physical obstacles, convenient placement of the machine.</p>
                <div class="list">
                    <p class="list-title">Main functions offered by an ATM:</p>
                    <ul class="ul-list">

                    the design solution.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="h2">Prioritization and idea selection</h2>
                <h3 class="h3">Here's an overview of how the design approach caters to different user segments:</h3>
                <span class="group-name">Youth and middle-aged adults</span>
                <p class="p p-space">This group is tech-savvy, so this feature can help them save a valuable
                    resource ‚Äî time. Although they perform most operations via mobile or internet banking, they
                    sometimes need to conduct cash transactions. This feature will allow them to use the ATM even
                    faster.</p>
                <span class="group-name">Teenagers</span>
                <p class="p p-space">They have no trouble understanding how various technologies work, but a key
                    specificity of
                    this user group is their insufficient financial literacy and parental control over their financial
                    activities. Fast functions will help teenagers lower the barrier to monetary and banking operations,
                    learn to perform them earlier, avoid getting lost in unnecessary functions, and give parents a bit
                    more control over their children's money.</p>
                <span class="group-name">Elderly people</span>
                <p class="p p-space"><span class="bg-color">We will prioritize this group separately in this
                        solution.</span> The ability to set up a
                    few of the most important functions for them via a mobile application with the help of relatives,
                    bank employees, or through "smart prompts" in mobile banking will reduce their fear of the ATM.</p>
                <span class="group-name">People with special health needs</span>
                <p class="p p-space">The diversity of health conditions complicates coverage assessment. Our feature, by
                    reducing on-screen elements and making them larger and clearer, along with audio assistant
                    integration, will significantly enhance user convenience and accessibility. While physical ATM
                    accessibility (height, absence of obstacles) remains crucial, simplifying the interface minimizes
                    movements, offering a valuable additional benefit.</p>
